#summary Details on Edge's caching system.

==Introduction==

Caching is an essential component for modern high traffic web applications. It helps scale the application and eleviate database load.

*Edge* supports three storage engines

  # Memcached ([http://memcached.org])
  # Redis ([http://redis.io])
  # File caching

The first 2 options store data in memory and are considerably faster than file caching, so opt for these options whenever possible.

==Configuration==

As any other services within *Edge*, we configure caching in the config.php file.

Below are some samples for each one of the 3 options
