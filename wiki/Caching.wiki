#summary Details on Edge's caching system.

==Introduction==

Caching is an essential component for modern high traffic web applications. It helps scale the application and eleviate database load.

*Edge* supports three storage engines

  # Memcached ([http://memcached.org])
  # Redis ([http://redis.io])
  # File caching

The first 2 options store data in memory and are considerably faster than file caching, so opt for these options whenever possible.

==Configuration==

As any other services within *Edge*, we configure caching in the config.php file.

Below are some samples for each one of the 3 options

{{{
        /**
         * Memcached storage
         * We can pass as many servers as we want
         * The order is host:port:weight
         */
        'cache' => array(
            'invokable' => 'Edge\Core\Cache\MemoryCache',
            'args' => array(
                array('master:11311:1')
            ),
            'shared' => true
        )

        /**
         * Redis storage
         */
        'cache' => array(
            'invokable' => 'Edge\Core\Cache\RedisCache',
            'args' => array('localhost:6379') ,
            'shared' => true
        )

        /**
         * File storage
         */
        'cache' => array(
            'invokable' => 'Edge\Core\Cache\FileCache',
            'args' => array('/data/cache'),
            'shared' => true
        )
}}}
