#summary How to install Edge on your system


In order to install *Edge* on your system you will need
  * *PHP 5.4*
  * *A web server (ie Apache)*

Additionally, 

  * To use memcached for caching you need php-memcache. Install via *pecl install memcache*

  * To use Redis for caching you need php-redis. Install via *pecl install redis*

  * To use MongoDB you need php-mongo. Install via *pecl install mongo*

Going into details on how you can install the above is out of the scope of this document, but a lot of information exists all over the web.

Checkout edge using a svn client

{{{
cd /var/www/
svn checkout http://php-edge.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ php-edge
}}}

Within the folder you will find 3 folders and 1 SQL file

  # *Edge* includes the framework libraries
  # *Application* includes a skeleton structure. Use this for your project
  # *Public* contains the bootstrap index.php and it is the directory that you should make public in your web server.
  # *structure.sql* contains sql statements for user and RBAC tables. This file is optional for running *Edge*

Now, let's create a virtual host within Apache, so that we can access *Edge* through the browser.
Paste the below directives to the apache config file
{{{
NameVirtualHost *:80

<VirtualHost *:80>
   DocumentRoot /var/www/php-edge/Public
   ServerName devel.edge.net
   <Directory /var/www/php-edge/Public>
        AllowOverride All
   </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
}}}

Restart apache in order for the changes to be applied.

Additionally, you need to add the domain we specified in the config section, to your hosts file.

You can now access *Edge* by visiting

{{{
http://devel.edge.net
}}}

You will be greeted with a Welcome page which can act as a starting point for your web application. You will find all the files under the Application folder.
