= Introduction =

In this introductory tutorial, we will be building an administration area, which allows the creation and management of sports and tournaments.
The purpose of this tutorial is to cover some of the basic concepts, such as CRUD operations along with an overview of some of the basic controllers and filters, which help speed up the development of web applications, by abstracting common operations such as session management and user authentication.

==Controllers==

All basic controllers of Edge are located under Edge/Controllers.
Every controller you create need to (directly or indirectly) inherit from BaseController.
Controllers can be thought as the public API of your web application. They allow the user (browser) to communicate with the core of your application.
